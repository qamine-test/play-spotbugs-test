# play-spotbugs-test

A Play application with spotbugs issues.

This application was developed to serve as a test-case for the usage of [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) with [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com), 
implemented through the [codacy-spotbugs integration](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-spotbugs) together with the [Codacy CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli).

## Running the test

- Requirements:
  - Installed the [Codacy CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli) (the latest version)
  - This application (`play-spotbugs-test`) is compiled 
  
- Running:

```
codacy-analysis-cli analyse --tool spotbugs --directory </PATH/to/TEST/application> --allow-network true
```

- Ouput:

The `codacy-analysis-cli` should output the following issues:
```
